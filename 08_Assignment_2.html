	<!-- QUESTION 8 : A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week, plus 9 percent of their gross sales for the week. For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of merchandise in a week receives $200 plus 9 percent of $5,000, or a total of $650. You have been supplied with a list of the items sold by each salesperson. The value of these items are as follows: Develop a script that inputs one salesperson’s items sold for last week, calculates the salesperson’s earnings, and outputs HTML5 text that displays the salesperson’s earnings.-->
